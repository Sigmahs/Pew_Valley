Building our Own World

Worked together with fellow UC Berkeley student Alyssa Nguyen to design and implement a game with a simple UI and soundtrack in java which can take in user input, randomly generates a level, and allows the user to save and load at any state of the game. Uses a package [edu.princeton.cs.algs4.StdDraw] to take in user keyboard input, implements 2D Array logic, and can read/write files.
